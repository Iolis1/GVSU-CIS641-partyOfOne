### Method Specification for `Summarization` Class

#### Method Signature:
- **Name:** `simplifySummary`
- **Parameters:** `testResultsSummary` (Type: String) - A detailed medical summary containing medical jargon.
- **Returns:** `simplifiedSummary` (Type: String) - A simplified version of the medical summary suitable for non-medical readers.

#### Preconditions:
- **Content Validity:** `testResultsSummary` must not be null or empty, ensuring there is content to process.
- **Content Requirement:** `testResultsSummary` should contain recognizable medical jargon that can be simplified. This is checked to ensure the input is appropriate for simplification.

#### Postconditions:
- **Result Validity:** The `simplifiedSummary` returned must not be null or empty, indicating successful processing.
- **Result Requirement:** The `simplifiedSummary` must be equal to or shorter in length than the `testResultsSummary` and must be in simpler language to ensure it is easier for non-medical readers to understand.

#### Invariants:
- **Model Consistency:** The `Summarization` class maintains a constant instance of the language model (`LLM instance`) that does not change once initialized, ensuring consistent output across uses.
- **Visibility:** The method `simplifySummary` is public, allowing it to be accessed wherever an object of `Summarization` class is instantiated.

#### Documentation:
- **General Information:** This method simplifies detailed medical test results summaries into plain language. It is part of the `Summarization` class which utilizes an LLM model for processing text.
- **Trigger Event:** Typically triggered by user request within an application where medical summaries need to be simplified for patient consumption.
- **Algorithm Specifications:** The method invokes an LLM-based simplification process, which includes tokenizing the input text, processing it through the model, and reconstructing the output to ensure it meets simplicity criteria.

#### Message Passing:
- **Input:** Takes in `testResultsSummary` as input.
- **Processing:** Passes this summary to the LLM for simplification.
- **Output:** Returns the simplified summary.

#### Handling Constraint Violations:
- **Input Validation:** Throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if preconditions are not met, such as if the `testResultsSummary` is null or does not contain necessary medical jargon.
- **Output Validation:** Ensures postconditions are met and throws a `RuntimeException` if the simplification fails or does not meet the expected criteria (e.g., if the output is not simpler or is null).
